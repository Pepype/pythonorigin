# PyWrapOrigin
A python wrapper to OriginLab that allows plotting graphs in Originlab using python. 

The module utilizes Origin C, LabTalk, and OriginExt to enable plotting Origin graphs from the ground up, without relying on making any template. 

Ideally, PyWrapOrigin would use only LabTalk and OriginExt to handle all operations, however, due to their limitations in functionality and unclarity in documentations, I have written some Origin C codes to extend the functionalities. For example, plotting in Origin would normally require some sort of presaved graph template, to which the users will send in new data, which I find quite inconvenient. With the help of Origin C, PyWrapOrigin can adjust axis settings without needing a template.
